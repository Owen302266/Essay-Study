# Bayesian Approach
**bayesian viewpoints:**
1. all data points are jointly distributed according to a distribution that is known except for some hyperparameters
2. the model parameters Î¸ are jointly distributed with the data

so we assume that the joint distribution is known in Bayesian model

**ML&MAP vs Bayesian:**

MAP : same variance for all values of x
Bayesian : 
	1. uneven distribution of x
	2. Values of x closer to the existing points in the training sets generally exhibit a smaller variance.
