# Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to survey and assess the state-of-the-art in automatic target recognition for synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR-ATR). The aim is not to develop an exhaustive survey of the voluminous literature, but rather to capture in one place the various approaches for implementing the SAR-ATR system. This paper is meant to be as self-contained as possible, and it approaches the SAR-ATR problem from a holistic end-to-end perspective. A brief overview for the breadth of the SAR-ATR challenges is conducted. This is couched in terms of a single-channel SAR, and it is extendable to multi-channel SAR systems. Stages pertinent to the basic SAR-ATR system structure are defined, and the motivations of the requirements and constraints on the system constituents are addressed. For each stage in the SAR-ATR processing chain, a taxonomization methodology for surveying the numerous methods published in the open literature is proposed. Carefully selected works from the literature are presented under the taxa proposed. Novel comparisons, discussions, and comments are pinpointed throughout this paper. A two-fold benchmarking scheme for evaluating existing SAR-ATR systems and motivating new system designs is proposed. The scheme is applied to the works surveyed in this paper. Finally, a discussion is presented in which various interrelated issues, such as standard operating conditions, extended operating conditions, and target-model design, are addressed. This paper is a contribution toward fulfilling an objective of end-to-end SAR-ATR system design. 

本文的目的是调查和评估合成孔径雷达图像 (SAR-ATR) 自动目标识别的最新技术水平。目的不是对大量文献进行详尽的调查，而是在一个地方收集实施 SAR-ATR 系统的各种方法。本文旨在尽可能独立，并从端到端的整体角度处理 SAR-ATR 问题。对 SAR-ATR 挑战的广度进行了简要概述。本文是通过单通道 SAR 来表述的，它可以扩展到多通道 SAR 系统。定义了与基本 SAR-ATR 系统结构相关的阶段，并解决了对系统组成部分的要求和约束的动机。对于 SAR-ATR 处理链中的每个阶段提出了一种用于分类公开文献中发表的众多方法的策略。在拟议的分类群下展示了从文献中精心挑选的方法。整篇论文都对新颖的比较、讨论和评论进行了精确定位。提出了一种用于评估现有 SAR-ATR 系统和激励新系统设计的双重基准测试方案，并将该方案应用于本文讨论的方法。最后，对各种相互关联的问题进行了讨论，例如标准操作条件、扩展操作条件和目标模型设计。本文对实现端到端 SAR-ATR 系统设计的目标具有较大帮助。

# Introduction

As early as 1886, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the reflection of radio waves from solid objects. However, the first use of radio waves to detect the presence of distant metallic objects was first patented in 1904 by Christian Hulsmeyer of Germany. In 1925, Breit and Tuve of the Carnegie Institution of Washington introduced pulsed transmissions (1 ms) for ranging. Before World War II, researchers in countries such as France, Britain, Germany, Soviet Union, United States and Japan worked independently and secretly on developing technologies that led to modern day version of radar. In 1934, American Robert M. Page of the Naval Research Laboratory demonstrated the first radar as a pulsed system. In 1934, the British were the first to fully exploit radar as a defense against  an aircraft attack. Radar is an acronym for radio detection and ranging that was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy [1]. 

早在 1886 年，海因里希·赫兹 (Heinrich Hertz) 就演示了固体物体对无线电波的反射。然而，德国的 Christian Hulsmeyer 于 1904 年才首次使用无线电波来检测远处金属物体的存在。 1925 年，华盛顿卡内基研究所的 Breit 和 Tuve 引入了用于测距的脉冲传输（1 毫秒）。第二次世界大战前，法国、英国、德国、苏联、美国和日本等国家的研究人员独立秘密地开发导致现代版本雷达的技术。 1934 年，美国海军研究实验室的罗伯特·M·佩奇展示了第一台脉冲系统雷达。 1934 年，英国人率先充分利用雷达来抵御飞机攻击。雷达是无线电探测和测距的首字母缩写词，由美国海军于 1940 年创造[1]。
