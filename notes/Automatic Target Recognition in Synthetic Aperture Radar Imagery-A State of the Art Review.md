# Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to survey and assess the state-of-the-art in automatic target recognition for synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR-ATR). The aim is not to develop an exhaustive survey of the voluminous literature, but rather to capture in one place the various approaches for implementing the SAR-ATR system. This paper is meant to be as self-contained as possible, and it approaches the SAR-ATR problem from a holistic end-to-end perspective. A brief overview for the breadth of the SAR-ATR challenges is conducted. This is couched in terms of a single-channel SAR, and it is extendable to multi-channel SAR systems. Stages pertinent to the basic SAR-ATR system structure are defined, and the motivations of the requirements and constraints on the system constituents are addressed. For each stage in the SAR-ATR processing chain, a taxonomization methodology for surveying the numerous methods published in the open literature is proposed. Carefully selected works from the literature are presented under the taxa proposed. Novel comparisons, discussions, and comments are pinpointed throughout this paper. A two-fold benchmarking scheme for evaluating existing SAR-ATR systems and motivating new system designs is proposed. The scheme is applied to the works surveyed in this paper. Finally, a discussion is presented in which various interrelated issues, such as standard operating conditions, extended operating conditions, and target-model design, are addressed. This paper is a contribution toward fulfilling an objective of end-to-end SAR-ATR system design.

# Introduction

As early as 1886, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the reflection of radio waves from solid objects. However, the first use of radio waves to detect the presence of distant metallic objects was first patented in 1904 by Christian Hulsmeyer of Germany. In 1925, Breit and Tuve of the Carnegie Institution of Washington introduced pulsed transmissions (1 ms) for ranging. Before World War II, researchers in countries such as France, Britain, Germany, Soviet Union, United States and Japan worked independently and secretly on developing technologies that led to modern day version of radar. In 1934, American Robert M. Page of the Naval Research Laboratory demonstrated the first radar as a pulsed system. In 1934, the British were the first to fully exploit radar as a defense against  an aircraft attack. Radar is an acronym for radio detection and ranging that was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy [1]. 

早在 1886 年，海因里希·赫兹 (Heinrich Hertz) 就演示了固体物体对无线电波的反射。然而，德国的 Christian Hulsmeyer 于 1904 年才首次使用无线电波来检测远处金属物体的存在。 1925 年，华盛顿卡内基研究所的 Breit 和 Tuve 引入了用于测距的脉冲传输（1 毫秒）。第二次世界大战前，法国、英国、德国、苏联、美国和日本等国家的研究人员独立且秘密地开发带来了现代版本雷达的技术。 1934 年，美国海军研究实验室的罗伯特·M·佩奇展示了第一台脉冲系统雷达。 1934 年，英国人率先充分利用雷达来抵御飞机攻击。雷达是无线电探测和测距的首字母缩写词，由美国海军于 1940 年创造[1]。

The development of modern high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was led by three key innovations. *The first of these was pulse compression which enabled radars to range-resolve closely spaced targets.* The most widely used pulse compression technique is linear frequency modulation (LFM), also known as chirp modulation, which was introduced in the early 1950s. Second, by 1951, it was possible to resolve closely spaced targets in angular position relative to the antenna beam center of side looking airborne radars. This was achieved through *Doppler filtering* which was pioneered by Carl Wiley of Goodyear Aircraft Corporation. Finally, high-resolution SAR was enabled through the advent of *a technique to synthesize a long aperture for storing the magnitude and phase of successive radar returns along the platform trajectory*. The integration ofthese innovations led to the formation ofthe *first focused SAR image at the University of Michigan in 1957* [2], [3].

现代高分辨率合成孔径雷达 (SAR) 的发展由三项关键创新引领。*其中第一个是脉冲压缩，它使雷达能够对间隔很近的目标进行距离分辨*。最广泛使用的脉冲压缩技术是于 20 世纪 50 年代初推出的线性频率调制 (LFM)。其次，到 1951 年，可以在相对于侧视机载雷达天线波束中心的角度位置上分辨间隔很近的目标。这是通过固特异飞机公司的 Carl Wiley 首创的*多普勒滤波*实现的。最后，通过合成长孔径技术的出现，高分辨率 SAR 得以实现，*该技术用于存储连续雷达沿平台轨迹返回的幅度和相位*。这些创新的整合导致 *1957 年密歇根大学形成了第一张聚焦 SAR 图像* [2]、[3]。

SAR is an active remote sensor (i.e., it carries its own illumination and it is not dependent on sunlight) which makes it functional in all-weather and day-and-night operating conditions (OCs). Focused SAR images are different from their optical counterparts in many aspects. Some distinctive characteristics of SAR images include (1) *a target size does not vary with the distance between the SAR sensor and the target*, (2) *the information about the imaged scene is carried in the magnitude of the radar backscatter (i.e., for a singlechannel SAR)*,1 (3) large *specular reflections* pertaining to a microwave mirror-like behavior result from man-made scenes and some natural objects (e.g., rocks), and (4) *high sensitivity* to the very small changes in the target’s pose and configuration for various reasons including: the shadowing effect, the interaction of the target’s backscatter with the environment (e.g., clutter, adjacent targets, etc.), projection of the 3-D scene (including the target) onto a slant plane (i.e., SAR’s line of sight (LOS)), and a noise-like phenomenon known as speckle due to the backscatter’s dependence on the coherent combination of returns from points in the imaged scene. 

SAR 是一个可以灵活独立使用的传感器 (即它携带自己的照明且不依赖于阳光) ，使它能在全天候和昼夜运行条件 ( OCs ) 中发挥作用。 聚焦 SAR 图像在许多方面与它们的光学部分对应。 SAR 图像的一些显着特征包括 : (1) *目标尺寸不随着SAR 传感器和目标之间的距离的变化而变化*， (2) *关于成像场景的信息被携带在雷达反向散射 ( 即，对于单通道SAR) 的大小中* (3) 与来自人造场景和一些自然物体 (例如岩石)的微波镜像行为结果有关的*大型镜面反射*， 以及 (4) 对目标姿态和配置中的微小变化的*高灵敏度*，包括 : 阴影效应，目标反向散射与环境的相互作用 (如杂波，相邻目标等 )， 3-D 场景 ( 包括目标 ) 投影到倾斜平面 (即 SAR的视线 (LOS))上，以及由于反向散射对来自成像场景中的点的相干组合的依赖而被称为斑点的噪声样现象。
