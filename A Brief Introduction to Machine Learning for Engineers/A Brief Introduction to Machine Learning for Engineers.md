## Basic
	Rather than requiring a precise model of the set-up under study, machine learning requires the speciﬁcation of an objective, of a model to be trained, and of an optimization technique.

	the approach has the key disadvantages of providing generally suboptimal performance, or hindering interpretability of the solution, and to apply only to a limited set of problems.

### when to use?
1. the task involves a function that maps well-deﬁned inputs to well- deﬁned outputs;
2. large dataset
3. clear feedback and definable goals and metrics
4. no logic or reasons depend on background knowledge or common sense
5. no explanation for how to decide
6. no need for correct answer
7. train data not change rapidly
8. no need for special needs 

		focus on training and computational statistics tools
